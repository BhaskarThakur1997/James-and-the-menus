# Approach

1. Initialize lists to store maximum prices (max_prices), count of good prices for each menu (good_prices_count), and total prices for each menu (total_prices).
2. Iterate through menus to find maximum prices for each item, update total prices, and count good prices.
3. Identify the menu with the maximum count of good prices.
4. Among menus with the maximum count, choose the one with the higher average price.
5. Return the index of the most updated menu.
   
# Note
- Calculate maximum prices and count good prices for each menu.
- Identify the most updated menu based on count and average price.
